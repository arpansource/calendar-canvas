## What is Calendar Canvas?

Calendar Canvas is a lightweight, zero-dependency calendar library that provides the essential logic and components for building calendar interfaces in React applications.

### ðŸ“… Flexible Views

- Month view
- Week view
- Day view
- Ability to switch between views seamlessly

### ðŸ›  Development Approach

- **Hooks-First Architecture**: Access calendar logic through custom hooks to build your UI from scratch
- **Component Library**: Pre-built components available for rapid development
- **TypeScript Support**: Built with TypeScript for better development experience

### âš¡ Core Strengths

- ðŸš€ Lightweight and performant
- ðŸ“± Responsive by design
- ðŸ”§ Easy to integrate
- ðŸŽ¯ Zero dependencies
- ðŸ’ª Built specifically for React
- ðŸ“¦ Tree-shakeable

## Two Ways to Use

### 1. Using Pre-built Components

Perfect for quick implementation with customizable styling:

```tsx
import {
  CalendarCanvas,
  CalendarContent,
  CalendarContentHeader,
  CalendarContentWrapper,
  CalendarHeader,
} from "calendar-canvas";
import "calendar-canvas/dist/main.css";

function Calendar() {
  return (
    <CalendarCanvas events={events} defaultView="month">
      <CalendarHeader />
      <CalendarContentWrapper>
        <CalendarContentHeader />
        <CalendarContent />
      </CalendarContentWrapper>
    </CalendarCanvas>
  );
}
```

### 2. Using Hooks for Custom Implementation

For complete control over the UI while leveraging calendar logic:

```tsx
import { useCalendarCanvas } from "calendar-canvas/hooks";

function CustomCalendar() {
  const {
    CalendarCanvas,
    // ... more calendar logic
  } = useCalendarCanvas();

  return <CalendarCanvas>{/* Your custom implementation */}</CalendarCanvas>;
}
```

## Why Choose Calendar Canvas?

- **Flexibility**: From using pre-built components to building completely custom UIs
- **Performance**: Lightweight core with optimized rendering
- **Developer Experience**: Comprehensive TypeScript support and intuitive API
- **Customization**: Total control over styling and behavior
- **Maintenance**: Zero dependencies means fewer security risks and smaller bundle size
